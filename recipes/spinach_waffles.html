    <h1>Spinach waffles</h1>
    <p>These Savory Green Waffles are super easy to make and a great savory breakfast or brunch option to change things up from regular sweet waffles. They're made in a blender and are freezer-friendly!</p>    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong> - You can use any milk you prefer. I like using dairy-free milk like cashew in this recipe but any works. <br>Who else can relate to never drinking dairy but eating it in the form of cheese as if that's not the same thing?!</li>
    <li><strong>Flour</strong> - Any flour works! I like using a gluten-free blend but all-purpose flour is great too. <br>I recommend staying away from coconut flour because it needs a lot of liquid and would make the waffles too dry.</li>
    <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - I always use large eggs. I haven't tried making this recipe vegan because the eggs are the main ingredient that holds everything together. <br>You can try using a vegan substitute but I can't promise it will work!</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese</strong> - any hard cheese works. I recommend avoiding soft cheeses because they would change the consistency of the batter</li>
    <li><strong>Spinach</strong> - I use fresh baby spinach. If you want to use frozen spinach, <br>I recommend defrosting it first and squeezing out any excess water. If you don't have spinach, you can also use kale.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step by step innstructions</h2>
    <p>There are 3 steps - very simple:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend all the ingredients </li>
        <li>Whisk that with the flour and cheddar in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Use your wafflemaker to make them.</li>
    </ol>

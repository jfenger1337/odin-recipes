    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Only 6 ingredients in our rolled low carb omelette. I have kept it basic but you can fill with your favourite fillings.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>- I use jumbo eggs from cage free pasture raised hens.</li>
        <li><strong>Swiss cheese</strong>- you can use any of your favourite cheeses.</li>
        <li><strong>Leg ham</strong>- substitute any protein or vegetables you prefer. Layer thinly so the omelette easy to roll.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>Step by step innstructions</h2>
    <p>easy to follow - let's dive into it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the eggs, sour cream, parmesan and seasoning to a large bowl and whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into a lined baking tray and bake for 10 minutes in a fan forced oven at 180Â°C.</li>
        <li>Turn the baked omelette out onto a silicone mat and layer with cheese and ham.</li>
        <li>Roll the filled omelette into roll lengthwise. Bake for a further 5 minutes to heat and melt the cheese. Serve hot or cold.</li>
    </ol>
